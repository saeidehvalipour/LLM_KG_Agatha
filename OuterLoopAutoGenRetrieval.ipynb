       "[['HIV Associated Neurocognitive Disorders. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is associated with the development of neurocognitive disorders in many infected individuals, including a broad spectrum of motor impairments and cognitive deficits. Despite extensive research, the pathogenesis of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) is still not clear. This review provides a comprehensive view of HAND, including HIV neuroinvasion, HAND diagnosis and different level of disturbances, influence of highly-active antiretroviral therapy to HIV-associated dementia (HAD), possible pathogenesis of HAD, etc. Together, this review will give a thorough and clear understanding of HAND, especially HAD, which will be vital for future research, diagnosis and treatment. ',\n",
       "  'A candidate gene study of intermediate histopathological phenotypes in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) describe a spectrum of neuropsychological impairment caused by HIV-1 infection. While the sequence of cellular and physiological events that lead to HAND remains obscure, it likely involves chronic neuroinflammation. Host genetic markers that increase the risk for HAND have been reported, but replication of such studies is lacking, possibly due to inconsistent application of a behavioral phenotype across studies. In the current study, we used histopathologic phenotypes in order to validate putative risk alleles for HAND. The National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium, a longitudinal study of the neurologic manifestations of HIV. Data and specimens were obtained from 175 HIV-infected adults. After determining several potential covariates of neurocognitive functioning, we quantified levels of six histopathological markers in the frontal lobe in association with neurocognitive functioning: SYP, MAP 2, HLA-DR, Iba1, GFAP, and beta-amyloid. We then determined alleles of 15 candidate genes for their associations with neurocognitive functioning and histopathological markers. Finally, we identified the most plausible causal pathway based on our data using a multi-stage linear regression-based mediation analysis approach. None of the genetic markers were associated with neurocognitive functioning. Of the histopathological markers, only MAP 2 and SYP were associated with neurocognitive functioning; however, MAP 2 and SYP did not vary as a function of genotype. Mediation analysis suggests a causal pathway in which presynaptic degeneration (SYP) leads to somatodendritic degeneration (MAP 2) and ultimately neurocognitive impairment. This study did not support the role of host genotype in the histopathology underlying HAND. The findings lend further support for synaptodendritic degeneration as the proximal underlying neuropathological substrate of HAND. ',\n",
       "  'Transcriptomic and Genetic Profiling of HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders. Early in the HIV pandemic, it became evident that people living with HIV (PLWH) develop a wide range of neurological and neurocognitive complications. Even after the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), which dramatically improved survival of PLWH, the overall number of people living with some form of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) seemed to remain unchanged, although the incidence of dementia declined and questions about the incidence and diagnosis of the mildest form of HAND arose. To better understand this complex disease, several transcriptomic analyses have been conducted in autopsy samples, as well as in non-human primates and small animal rodent models. However, genetic studies in the HIV field have mostly focused on the genetic makeup of the immune system. Much less is known about the genetic underpinnings of HAND. Here, we provide a summary of reported transcriptomic and epigenetic changes in HAND, as well as some of the potential genetic underpinnings that have been linked to HAND, and discuss future directions with hurdles to overcome and angles that remain to be explored.

HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) describe a spectrum of neuropsychological impairment caused by HIV-1 infection. While the sequence of cellular and physiological events that lead to HAND remains obscure, it likely involves chronic neuroinflammation. Host genetic markers that increase the risk for HAND have been reported, but replication of such studies is lacking, possibly due to inconsistent application of a behavioral phenotype across studies. In the current study, we used histopathologic phenotypes in order to validate putative risk alleles for HAND. The National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium, a longitudinal study of the neurologic manifestations of HIV. Data and specimens were obtained from 175 HIV-infected adults. After determining several potential covariates of neurocognitive functioning, we quantified levels of six histopathological markers in the frontal lobe in association with neurocognitive functioning: SYP, MAP 2, HLA-DR, Iba1, GFAP, and beta-amyloid. We then determined alleles of 15 candidate genes for their associations with neurocognitive functioning and histopathological markers. Finally, we identified the most plausible causal pathway based on our data using a multi-stage linear regression-based mediation analysis approach. None of the genetic markers were associated with neurocognitive functioning. Of the histopathological markers, only MAP 2 and SYP were associated with neurocognitive functioning; however, MAP 2 and SYP did not vary as a function of genotype. Mediation analysis suggests a causal pathway in which presynaptic degeneration (SYP) leads to somatodendritic degeneration (MAP 2) and ultimately neurocognitive impairment. This study did not support the role of host genotype in the histopathology underlying HAND. The findings lend further support for synaptodendritic degeneration as the proximal underlying neuropathological substrate of HAND. ',\n",

Even after the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), which dramatically improved survival of PLWH, the overall number of people living with some form of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) seemed to remain unchanged, although the incidence of dementia declined and questions about the incidence and diagnosis of the mildest form of HAND arose. To better understand this complex disease, several transcriptomic analyses have been conducted in autopsy samples, as well as in non-human primates and small animal rodent models. However, genetic studies in the HIV field have mostly focused on the genetic makeup of the immune system. Much less is known about the genetic underpinnings of HAND.

Despite an augmented research effort and scale-up of highly active antiretroviral therapy, a high prevalence of HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) persists in the HIV-infected population. Nearly 50 % of all HIV-1-infected individuals suffer from a neurocognitive disorder due to neural and synaptodendritic damage. Challenges in HAND research, including limited availability of brain tissue from HIV patients, variation in HAND study protocols, and virus genotyping inconsistency and errors, however, have resulted in studies with insufficient power to delineate molecular mechanisms underlying HAND pathogenesis. There exists, therefore, a great need for a reliable and centralized resource specific to HAND research, particularly for epidemiological study and surveillance in resource-limited countries where severe forms of HAND persist. To address the aforementioned imperative need, here we present the HAND Database, a resource containing well-curated and up-to-date HAND virus information and associated clinical and epidemiological data. This database provides information on 5,783 non-redundant HIV-1 sequences from global HAND research published to date, representing a total of 163 unique individuals that have been assessed for HAND. A user-friendly interface allows for flexible searching, filtering, browsing, and downloading of data. The most comprehensive database of its kind, the HAND Database not only bolsters current HAND research by increasing sampling power and reducing study biases caused by protocol variation and genotyping inconsistency, it allows for comparison between HAND studies across different dimensions. Development of the HAND Database has also revealed significant knowledge gaps in HIV-driven neuropathology. These gaps include inadequate sequencing of viral genes beyond env, lack of HAND viral data from HIV epidemiologically important regions including Asian and Sub-Saharan African countries, and biased sampling toward the male gender, all factors that impede efforts toward providing an improved quality of life to HIV-infected individuals, and toward elimination of viruses in the brain. Our aim with the HAND database is to provide researchers in both the HIV and neuroscience fields a comprehensive and rigorous data source toward better understanding virus compartmentalization and to help in design of improved strategies against HAND viruses. We also expect this resource, which will be updated on a regular basis, to be useful as a reliable reference for further HAND epidemiology studies.

HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) often complicates HIV infection despite combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) and may be influenced by host genomics. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of HAND in 1,050 CNS HIV Anti-Retroviral Therapy Effects Research (CHARTER) Study participants. All participants underwent standardized, comprehensive neurocognitive, and neuromedical assessments to determine if they had cognitive impairment as assessed by the Global Deficit Score (GDS), and individuals with comorbidities that could confound diagnosis of HAND were excluded. Neurocognitive outcomes included GDS-defined neurocognitive impairment (NCI; binary GDS, 366 cases with GDS >= 0.5 and 684 controls with GDS < 0.5, and GDS as a continuous variable) and Frascati HAND definitions that incorporate assessment of functional impairment by self-report and performance-based criteria. Genotype data were obtained using the Affymetrix Human SNP Array 6.0 platform. Multivariable logistic or linear regression-based association tests were performed for GDS-defined NCI and HAND. GWAS results did not reveal SNPs meeting the genome-wide significance threshold (5.0 * 10-8 ) for GDS-defined NCI or HAND. For binary GDS, the most significant SNPs were rs6542826 (P = 8.1 * 10-7 ) and rs11681615 (1.2 * 10-6 ), both located on chromosome 2 in SH3RF3. The most significant SNP for continuous GDS was rs11157436 (P = 1.3 * 10-7 ) on chromosome 14 in the T-cell-receptor alpha locus; three other SNPs in this gene were also associated with binary GDS (P <= 2.9 * 10-6 ).

Cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of HIV RNA, proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, INF-gamma, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta1, and TGF-beta2) and chemokines (MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and MCP-1) in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of HIV-infected patients with CD4 <200/muL. HAND was diagnosed at baseline in 6/12 patients. Baseline CSF HIV-RNA was comparable in patients with or without HAND, whereas CSF concentration of IL-6 and MIP-1beta, proinflammatory cytokines, was increased in HAND patients. CSF evaluation at 12 weeks was available in 10/12 cases. ART greatly reduced HIV-RNA in all patients. Nevertheless, IL-6 and MIP-1beta remained elevated after 12 weeks of therapy in HAND patients, in whom CSF HIV RNA decay was slower than the plasmatic one as well. Immune activation, as indicated by inflammatory cytokines, but not higher levels of HIV-RNA is observed in advanced naive HIV-infected patients with HAND. In HAND patients, ART introduction resulted in a less rapid clearance of CSF viremia compared to plasma and no modifications of intratechal immune activation. ',\n",
       " 'Druggable targets of the endocannabinoid system: Implications for the treatment of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) affects nearly half of all HIV-infected individuals. Synaptodendritic damage correlates with neurocognitive decline in HAND, and many studies have demonstrated that HIV-induced neuronal injury results from excitotoxic and inflammatory mechanisms. The endocannabinoid (eCB) system provides on-demand protection against excitotoxicity and neuroinflammation. Here, we discuss evidence of the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of the eCB system from in vitro and in vivo studies. We examine the pharmacology of the eCB system and evaluate the therapeutic potential of drugs that modulate eCB signaling to treat HAND. Finally, we provide perspective on the need for additional studies to clarify the role of the eCB system in HIV neurotoxicity and speculate that strategies that enhance eCB signaling might slow cognitive decline in HAND.

       " 'Effect of HIV Subtype and Antiretroviral Therapy on HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder Stage in Rakai, Uganda. Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) improves HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) stage in the United States where subtype B predominates, but the effect of ART and subtype on HAND stage in individuals in Uganda with subtypes D and A is largely unknown. A community-based cohort of participants residing in Rakai, Uganda. Three hundred ninety-nine initially ART-naive HIV-seropositive (HIV+) individuals were followed up over 2 years. Neurological and neuropsychological tests and functional assessments were used to determine HAND stage. Frequency and predictors of HAND and HIV-associated dementia (HAD) were assessed at baseline and at follow-up after ART initiation in 312 HIV+ individuals. HIV subtype was determined from gag and env sequences. At 2-year follow-up, HAD frequency among HIV+ individuals on ART (n = 312) decreased from 13% to 5% (P < 0.001), but the overall frequency of HAND remained unchanged (56%-51%). Subtype D was associated with higher rates of impaired cognition (global deficit score >= 0.5) compared with HIV+ individuals with subtype A (55% vs. 24%) (P = 0.008). Factors associated with HAD at baseline were older age, depression, and plasma HIV viral load >100,000 copies/mL. At follow-up, age and depression remained significantly associated with HAD. HIV+ individuals on ART in rural Uganda had a significant decrease in the frequency of HAD, but HAND persists after 2 years on ART. The current guideline of immediate ART initiation after HIV diagnosis is likely to greatly reduce HAD in sub-Saharan Africa. Further studies of the effect of HIV subtype and neurocognitive performance are warranted. ']"

      "HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder in HIV-infected Koreans: the Korean NeuroAIDS Project. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) is an independent predictor of early mortality and is associated with many difficulties in activities of daily living. We sought to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for HAND in HIV-infected Koreans. In addition, we investigated the performance of screening tools and components of neuropsychological (NP) tests for diagnosing HAND. HIV-infected patients were enrolled consecutively from two different urban teaching hospitals in Seoul, South Korea between March 2012 and September 2012. Participants completed a detailed NP assessment of six cognitive domains commonly affected by HIV. The Frascati criteria were used for diagnosing HAND. Four key questions, the International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)-K were also assessed as potential tools for screening for HAND. Among the 194 participants, the prevalence of HAND was 26.3%. Asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment and minor neurocognitive disorder accounted for 52.9 and 47.1% of the patients with HAND, respectively. In multivariate analysis, haemoglobin (Hb) level <= 13 g/dL (P = 0.046) and current use of a protease inhibitor-based regimen (P = 0.031) were independent risk factors for HAND. The sensitivity and specificity of the IHDS were 72.6 and 60.8%, and those of MoCA-K were 52.9 and 73.4%, respectively. The IHDS (P < 0.001) and MoCA-K (P < 0.001) were both useful for screening for HAND. Among NP tests, the sensitivity and specificity of the Grooved Pegboard Test were 90.2 and 72.0%, and those of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test were 61.2 and 84.4%, respectively. HAND is a prevalent comorbidity in HIV-infected Koreans. Active screening and diagnosis with effective tools, such as the IHDS, MoCA-K and Grooved Pegboard Test, could be used to identify this important complication. \n",

      "Adult brain volume in multiple sclerosis: The impact of paediatric onset. Paediatric onset multiple sclerosis (POMS) is associated with reduced brain and deep grey matter volume in comparison with that in healthy controls and individuals with adult onset multiple sclerosis (AOMS). The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of POMS on adult brain volume with adjustment for other parameters, such as disease duration. We recruited 20 POMS and 40 AOMS patients and 20 healthy controls matched for age and sex. All study participants were adults at the time of inclusion in the study. All study subjects underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate whole brain, white matter, grey matter, cortical, and deep grey matter volumes. Clinical features, such as the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score and disease duration, were also assessed. Brain (p = 0.01), grey matter (p = 0.01), and deep grey matter volume (p = 0.03) was significantly lower in POMS patients than in AOMS patients, while no differences were detected in the volume of white matter or cortical grey matter. A multiple linear regression analysis showed a relationship between brain volume (dependent variable) and the independent variables age (p < 0.000) and paediatric onset (p < 0.001), while other independent variables, including disease duration, sex, and disability, were not significantly different among groups. There were significant differences in thalamic volume among POMS and AOMS patients and healthy controls. Our data support the previous findings that POMS patients have reduced brain and deep grey matter volume, particularly thalamic volume, compared with sex- and age-matched AOMS patients and healthy controls. These findings appear to be independent of disease duration and other clinical features. \n",

      "HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders and central nervous system drug penetration: what next? The current prevalence of cognitive impairment in HIV-infected individuals is surprisingly high, even in those with undetectable plasma HIV RNA. The aetiology is unknown but one possibility is inadequate control of persistent central nervous system (CNS) HIV infection. The CNS Penetration Effectiveness (CPE) rank has been proposed to predict how well an antiretroviral regimen treats CNS infection. Fabbiani et al. report that 'correcting' the CPE rank of each drug in an individual's regimen for the results of genotypic susceptibility (the CPE-GSS score) results in better ability to predict whether the regimen will improve cognition. The CPE-GSS score may help us better understand the aetiology of HIV-associated cognitive impairment. Whether it will be useful in the management of individual patients requires further study. \n",

This cross-sectional study examines differences among healthy elderly controls and patients with vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI) and vascular dementia (VaD) in performances on CAMCOG subscales. Elderly individuals (n=61) were divided into 3 groups, according to cognitive and neuroimaging status: 16 controls, 20 VaMCI and 25 VaD.

      "Diffusion histology imaging differentiates distinct pediatric brain tumor histology. High-grade pediatric brain tumors exhibit the highest cancer mortality rates in children. While conventional MRI has been widely adopted for examining pediatric high-grade brain tumors clinically, accurate neuroimaging detection and differentiation of tumor histopathology for improved diagnosis, surgical planning, and treatment evaluation, remains an unmet need in their clinical management. We employed a novel Diffusion Histology Imaging (DHI) approach employing diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) derived metrics as the input classifiers for deep neural network analysis. DHI aims to detect, differentiate, and quantify heterogeneous areas in pediatric high-grade brain tumors, which include normal white matter (WM), densely cellular tumor, less densely cellular tumor, infiltrating edge, necrosis, and hemorrhage. Distinct diffusion metric combination would thus indicate the unique distributions of each distinct tumor histology features. DHI, by incorporating DBSI metrics and the deep neural network algorithm, classified pediatric tumor histology with an overall accuracy of 85.8%. Receiver operating analysis (ROC) analysis suggested DHI's great capability in distinguishing individual tumor histology with AUC values (95% CI) of 0.984 (0.982-0.986), 0.960 (0.956-0.963), 0.991 (0.990-0.993), 0.950 (0.944-0.956), 0.977 (0.973-0.981) and 0.976 (0.972-0.979) for normal WM, densely cellular tumor, less densely cellular tumor, infiltrating edge, necrosis and hemorrhage, respectively. Our results suggest that DBSI-DNN, or DHI, accurately characterized and classified multiple tumor histologic features in pediatric high-grade brain tumors. If these results could be further validated in patients, the novel DHI might emerge as a favorable alternative to the current neuroimaging techniques to better guide biopsy and resection as well as monitor therapeutic response in patients with high-grade brain tumors. \n",

      "High prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder in HIV-infected patients with a baseline CD4 count <= 350 cells/muL in Shanghai, China. This study sought to determine the prevalence and risk factors of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) in HIV-infected patients with a baseline CD4 count <= 350 cells/muL in Shanghai, China. Subjects were 309 HIV-infected patients with a baseline CD4 count <= 350 cells/muL. General demographic and clinical information were collected by patient interview. Patients' cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), combined with a questionnaire on cognitive complaints. The median age of patients was 34 years (IQR: 28-43.5). In terms of sex, 272 (88.0%) of the patients were male. Of the patients, 236 (76.4%) had been on antiretroviral treatment (ART) (for a median duration of 14 months, IQR: 1-29 months) before the study. Of the patients, 183 (59.2%) mentioned having a cognitive disorder. MoCA screening revealed that the prevalence of HAND was 48.2% and that HAND was more prevalent in patients with cognitive complaints (53.0%) than in patients with no such complaints (41.3%) (p = 0.042). Multivariate analysis indicated that HAND was associated with being female (p = 0.006), being older (p < 0.001), having a lower level of education (p < 0.001), and longer use of efavirenz in an ART regimen (p = 0.040). This study found that HAND frequently developed in HIV-infected patients with a baseline CD4 count <= 350 cells/muL in Shanghai, China. Being older, being female, having a low level of education, and receiving efavirenz treatment for a longer period may be associated with a greater risk of developing HAND. This study suggests that HAND should be routinely screened for in all newly diagnosed HIV-positive patients, and especially in those with the aforementioned risk factors for developing HAND. \n",

      "Agonist-induced phosphorylation of the vascular type 1 angiotensin II receptor. Agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation plays a role in transmembrane signal transduction systems. Although the cDNA for the rat vascular type 1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1AR) encodes a G protein-coupled receptor with several potential phosphorylation sites for serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases, little is known about the phosphorylation of this receptor. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) on phosphorylation of the AT1AR in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells. Using [32P]orthophosphate-labeled cells, immunoprecipitates with anti-AT1AR antibody revealed a labeled band of molecular weight 52 kD, corresponding to the Ang II receptor. Ang II induced a rapid and significant increase in phosphorylation of the Ang II receptor, with a peak at 20 minutes. Phosphoamino acid analysis showed that the major phosphoamino acid is serine, in both the basal and Ang II-stimulated states. Constitutive and agonist-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation is also observed to a lesser extent. Immunoblotting of anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates with anti-AT1AR antibody showed that Ang II caused a delayed tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor with a peak at 20 minutes in a dose-dependent manner. Forskolin increased total phosphorylation of AT1AR but had no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation. Neither phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate nor ionomycin altered receptor phosphorylation. These findings suggest that Ang II induces the phosphorylation of its own G protein-coupled receptor through both serine and tyrosine kinases and raise the possibility that phosphorylation of the AT1AR is an important regulator of receptor function. \n",

      "SDF-1/CXCR4 mediates acute protection of cardiac function through myocardial STAT3 signaling following global ischemia/reperfusion injury. Stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1) has been reported to mediate cardioprotection through the mobilization of stem cells into injured tissue and an increase in local angiogenesis after myocardial infarction. However, little is known regarding whether SDF-1 induces acute protection following global myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and if so, by what molecular mechanism. SDF-1 binding to its cognate receptor CXCR4 has been shown to activate STAT3 in a variety of cells. STAT3 is a cardioprotective factor and may mediate SDF-1/CXCR4-induced acute protection. We hypothesized that SDF-1 would improve myocardial function through CXCR4-increased STAT3 activation following acute I/R. Isolated mouse hearts were subjected to 25-min global ischemia/40-min reperfusion and divided into groups of 1) vehicle; 2) SDF-1; 3) AMD3100, a CXCR4 inhibitor; 4) SDF-1 + AMD3100; 5) Stattic, a STAT3 inhibitor; 6) SDF-1 + Stattic; 7) cardiomyocyte-restricted ablation of STAT3 (STAT3KO); 8) STAT3KO + SDF-1; 9) Ly294002, an inhibitor of the Akt pathway; and 10) SDF-1 + Ly294002. Reagents were infused into hearts within 5 min before ischemia. SDF-1 administration significantly improved postischemic myocardial functional recovery in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, pretreatment with SDF-1 reduced cardiac apoptotic signaling and increased myocardial STAT3 activation following acute I/R. Inhibition of the SDF-1 receptor CXCR4 neutralized these protective effects by SDF-1 in hearts subjected to I/R. Notably, inhibition of the STAT3 pathway or use of STAT3KO hearts abolished SDF-1-induced acute protection following myocardial I/R. Our results represent the first evidence that the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis upregualtes myocardial STAT3 activation and, thereby, mediates acute cardioprotection in response to global I/R. \n",

      "Muscle-specific microRNA-206 targets multiple components in dystrophic skeletal muscle representing beneficial adaptations. Over the last several years, converging lines of evidence have indicated that miR-206 plays a pivotal role in promoting muscle differentiation and regeneration, thereby potentially impacting positively on the progression of neuromuscular disorders, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Despite several studies showing the regulatory function of miR-206 on target mRNAs in skeletal muscle cells, the effects of overexpression of miR-206 in dystrophic muscles remain to be established. Here, we found that miR-206 overexpression in mdx mouse muscles simultaneously targets multiple mRNAs and proteins implicated in satellite cell differentiation, muscle regeneration, and at the neuromuscular junction. Overexpression of miR-206 also increased the levels of several muscle-specific mRNAs/proteins, while enhancing utrophin A expression at the sarcolemma. Finally, we also observed that the increased expression of miR-206 in dystrophin-deficient mouse muscle decreased the production of proinflammatory cytokines and infiltration of macrophages. Taken together, our results show that miR-206 acts as a pleiotropic regulator that targets multiple key mRNAs and proteins expected to provide beneficial adaptations in dystrophic muscle, thus highlighting its therapeutic potential for DMD. \n",

      "Glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) controls inflammation and tissue damage after spinal cord injury. Spinal cord injury (SCI) occurs following damage to the spinal column. Following trauma, tissue damage is further exacerbated by a secondary damage due to a SCI-activated inflammatory process. Control of leukocytes activity is essential to therapeutic inhibition of the spinal cord damage to ameliorate the patient's conditions. The mechanisms that regulate neuroinflammation following SCI, including T-cell infiltration, have not been completely clarified. Glucocorticoids (GC) are antiinflammatory drugs widely used in therapy, including treatment of SCI. GC efficacy may be linked to many molecular mechanisms that are involved in regulation of leukocytes migration, activation, and differentiation. We have previously shown that the antiinflammatory activity of GC is in part mediated by glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ). Here, we investigated the role of GILZ in inflammation and spinal cord tissue damage following a spinal trauma. We address the role of GILZ in SCI-induced inflammation and tissue damage using a model of SCI in gilz knockout (gilz KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. We found that GILZ deficiency is associated with a strong reduction of SCI-induced inflammation and a significantly reduced lesion area following SCI. These results demonstrate that GILZ is involved in induction of neuroinflammation and functional outcomes of spinal cord trauma. \n",

In this study, we demonstrated the pervasiveness of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) among a selection of Japanese patients as well as evaluated and compared the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS) for use as a screening tool among combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART)-naive and cART experienced patients. The MMSE and the IHDS have both been used as HAND screening tests around the world with variable success. It has been reported the increased usage of cART the utility of these screening tests may have been diminished due to the decreased severity of impairment and the altered pattern of neurocognitive impairments in cART era HAND patients. It is therefore possible the MMSE and the IHDS may still be useful among cART-naive patients even in the cART era. However, only one study has investigated and compared the screening results of the IHDS among cART-naive and cART experienced patients. All HIV positive patients who visited, or were admitted, to the Ryukyu University Hospital between January 2009 and March 2014 were evaluated for inclusion. Selected patients (n = 49) had data without omission for all tests. The overall prevalence of HAND in our cohort was 44%.

The abstracts cover diverse topics: the first discusses the delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence in a cyanine dye, Cy5; the second explores the self-assembly of molecular ions via like-charge ion interactions; and the third focuses on the prevalence of HAND among Japanese patients and the effectiveness of screening tests for HAND in the context of cART (combination antiretroviral therapy) usage.\n",

Without such specific information, it's not possible to accurately describe a relationship between HAND and AGTR1 based on the provided abstracts.\n",

AGTR1-mediated pathways are implicated in this inflammatory process.    Angiotensin II Receptor Type 1 (AT1R) and Neuroinflammation: AGTR1, through its product, the AT1R, is involved in modulating microglia activation and neuroinflammation. Angiotensin II, the ligand for AT1R, induces microglia activation, affecting the function of neurons.    Modulation of AT1R to Mitigate Neuroinflammation: Strategies that modulate AT1R, such as the use of inhibitors like losartan or candesartan, have been shown to have therapeutic effects in models of HAND and other neuroinflammatory conditions. They can reduce neuroinflammation and thereby potentially alleviate the symptoms of HAND.    Endothelin A2 (EPA2) and AT1R: One study suggests that EPA2, which is involved in the endocytosis of GPCRs including AT1R, might modulate microglial activation by affecting AT1R. Therapeutic agents that increase EPA2 expression might decrease AT1R expression, reducing neuroinflammation and neuronal damage.    Therapeutic Potential: The inhibition of AGTR1 has been shown to have neuroprotective effects, suggesting that targeting this receptor could be a viable strategy for reducing secondary brain damage and inflammation after trauma, which may also be relevant to HAND pathology.In summary, the AGTR1 gene, through its association with the AT1R, appears to be involved in the neuroinflammatory pathways that contribute to the pathogenesis of HAND. Pharmacological modulation of this receptor, such as through the use of AT1R antagonists, has been demonstrated to have potential therapeutic effects in reducing neuroinflammation and secondary neuronal damage, which are key features of HAND.'"

      " Biochanin A protects against angiotensin II-induced damage of dopaminergic neurons in rats associated with the increased endophilin A2 expression. The brain renin-angiotensin system plays a vital role in the modulation of the neuroinflammatory responses and the progression of dopaminergic (DA) degeneration. Angiotensin II (Ang II) induces microglia activation via angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), which in turn affects the function of DA neurons. Endophilin A2 (EPA2) is involved in fast endophilin-mediated endocytosis and quickly endocytoses several G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), while AT1R belongs to GPCR family. Therefore, we speculated that EPA2 may modulate microglia activation via endocytosing AT1R. Biochanin A is an O-methylated isoflavone, classified as a kind of phytoestrogen due to its chemical structure that is similar to mammalian estrogens. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of biochanin A on Ang II-induced DA neurons damage in vivo, and molecular mechanisms. The results showed that biochanin A treatment for 7 days attenuated the behavioral dysfunction, inhibited the microglial activation, and prevented DA neuron damage in Ang II-induced rats. Furthermore, biochanin A increased EPA2 expression and decreased the expression of AT1R, gp91phox, p22 phox, NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-alpha. In summary, these results suggest that biochanin A exerts protective effects in Ang II-induced model rats, and the mechanisms may involve inhibition of inflammatory responses, an increase in EPA2 expression and a decrease in AT1R expression. \n",

      "Angiotensin II Signal Transduction: An Update on Mechanisms of Physiology and Pathophysiology. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays crucial roles in cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology. However, many of the signaling mechanisms have been unclear. The angiotensin II (ANG II) type 1 receptor (AT1R) is believed to mediate most functions of ANG II in the system. AT1R utilizes various signal transduction cascades causing hypertension, cardiovascular remodeling, and end organ damage. Moreover, functional cross-talk between AT1R signaling pathways and other signaling pathways have been recognized. Accumulating evidence reveals the complexity of ANG II signal transduction in pathophysiology of the vasculature, heart, kidney, and brain, as well as several pathophysiological features, including inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and aging. In this review, we provide a comprehensive update of the ANG II receptor signaling events and their functional significances for potential translation into therapeutic strategies. AT1R remains central to the system in mediating physiological and pathophysiological functions of ANG II, and participation of specific signaling pathways becomes much clearer. There are still certain limitations and many controversies, and several noteworthy new concepts require further support. However, it is expected that rigorous translational research of the ANG II signaling pathways including those in large animals and humans will contribute to establishing effective new therapies against various diseases. \n",

      "Angiotensin receptor expression revealed by reporter mice and beneficial effects of AT2R agonist in retinal cells. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a vital role in cardiovascular physiology and body homeostasis. In addition to circulating RAS, a local RAS exists in the retina. Dysfunction of local RAS, resulting in increased levels of Angiotensin II (Ang II) and activation of AT1R-mediated signaling pathways, contributes to tissue pathophysiology and end-organ damage. Activation of AT2R on other hand is known to counteract the effects of AT1R activation and produce anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. We examined the expression of angiotensin receptors in the retina by using transgenic dual reporter mice and by real-time RT-PCR. We further evaluated the effects of C21, a selective agonist of AT2R, in reducing Ang II, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in cultured human ARPE-19 cells. We showed that both AT1Ra and AT2R positive cells are detected in different cell types of the eye, including the RPE/choroid complex, ciliary body/iris, and neural retina. AT1Ra is more abundantly expressed than AT2R in mouse retina, consistent with previous reports. In the neural retina, AT1Ra are also detected in photoreceptors whereas AT2R are mostly expressed in the inner retinal neurons and RGCs. In cultured human RPE cells, activation of AT2R with C21 significantly blocked Ang II, LPS and hydrogen peroxide -induced NF-kappaB activation and inflammatory cytokine expression; Ang II and hydrogen peroxide-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and MG132-induced apoptosis, comparable to the effects of Angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)), another protective component of the RAS, although C21 is more potent in reducing some of the effects induced by Ang II, whereas Ang-(1-7) is more effective in reducing some of the LPS and hydrogen peroxide-induced effects. These results suggest that activation of AT2R may represent a new therapeutic approach for retinal diseases. As a response, return only the summary of the provided context as one or two sentences.\n"
